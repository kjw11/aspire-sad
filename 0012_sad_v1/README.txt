 This directory contains files generated by the Chime 6 baseline
 recipe.  It contains the models used to perform speech activity
 detection in track 2 of the challenge. 

 The contents of this directory should be placed in egs/chime6/s5_track2/
 or a similar directory, with symbolic links to steps/, utils/, etc.

     final.raw                The TDNN-Stats SAD model, trained on Chime-6 data
     lda.mat                  Full-rank matrix for the fixed-affine-layer transformation
                              (Look for "Input features to the neural net" at: 
                              https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/dnn2.html for a description)
     lda_stats                Stats file for the LDA matrix
     post_output.vec          Manually tuned prior for normalizing the nnet output
     frame_subsampling_factor This contains the frame subsampling factor used while
                              training the network (in this case, 3)
     cmvn_opts                Mean and variance normalization options used while training
     srand                    The RNG seed used when creating the DNN
